# ebozz

ebozz is a Z-machine interpreter written in ES2015.

## What story files work with it

Anything <= version 3 should at least show text and respond to input.  I have yet to play through any game completely.

## Why?

I wanted to play Trinity (version 4, so still not working), and wanted a task that felt smaller than some of the
things I have to do for toshok/echojs.

## License

do whatever you want with it.
